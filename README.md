# IntroPython
Homework and Projects from my first python class

First OOP is my very first object oriented design project. It uses the following assignment to guide the code.

"Your Program
You can develop a program using Python language that will satisfy the functionality specified above. Based
on your understanding and interpretation, there are many ways to develop such a program to satisfy above
requirement specification. Therefore, please use your creativity to come up with a suitable design, that is
which class will contain which functionality, which methods and so on. Please also keep your main focus to
use various good programming techniques and practices that you have learnt in this course. For example,
you should use proper exception handling with appropriate error messages at suitable places where you
can expect exceptions and errors in your programme. The final output of your implementation should be
a bunch of Python classes with some example code for testing the use cases/scenarios such as
1. Adding/deleting a new course,
2. Creating and adding students to a course,
3. Grading of the mandatory assignments i.e. a pass/fail for a student etc.
4. To get an overview at the diploma programme/course level to see how many students passed the
programme and similarly
5. Test code to show the lists of students: a) who passed with distinction, b) passed and c) failed."

I completed this project alone right after learning to code for the first time. 


The Final Exam is the code that [@Annayathamma](https://github.com/Annayathamma) and I completed and the parameters are outlined in the notebook.
